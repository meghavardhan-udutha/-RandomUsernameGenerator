 Project Title: Random Username Generator
 
 Objective: The goal of this project is to create a Python program that generates unique and fun usernames
 suitable for social media or gaming platforms. This project will help you practice basic Python concepts
 such as working with lists, randomization, and file handling.
 
 Project Features:
 1. Combine Random Adjectives and Nouns:
 Generate usernames by combining a list of pre-defined adjectives and nouns. For example, "CoolTiger123" or "HappyDragon!".

 2. Customization Options:- Allow users to include numbers or special characters in the generated usernames.- Optionally set the length or structure of the usernames.
    
 3. Save Usernames to a File:- Save the generated usernames to a text file for future use or sharing.
    
 4. Interactive User Input:- Include options for users to specify their preferences (e.g., add numbers, special characters, or both).
    
 Tips for Success:
 1. Plan Your Code:- Break the project into small tasks such as defining adjective/noun lists, generating random combinations, and saving output to a
 file.
 2. Use Python Libraries:- Leverage Pythonâ€™s random module to generate random choices for adjectives and nouns.- Use the open() function for file handling to save usernames.
 3. Error Handling:- Ensure the program handles user input gracefully (e.g., invalid options).
 4. Test Thoroughly:- Test the program with different inputs and combinations to ensure it works as expected.
 5. Make it User-Friendly:
 Use clear prompts and messages to guide the user through the program
